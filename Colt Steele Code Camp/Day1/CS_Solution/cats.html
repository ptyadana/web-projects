  <h1>Big cats</h1>

  <p>The term "<b>big cat</b>" is typically used to refer to any of the five living members of the genus namely tiger,
    lion
    jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard. Except the snow leopard, these species are able to roa A more liberal and
    expansive
    definition of the term includes species outside of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera">
      <i>Panthera</i></a> including the couga clouded leopard, Sunda
    clouded
    leopard, cheetah and sometimes the several lynx species, although these add species also do not roar.</p>

  <p>Despite enormous differences in size, various cat species are quite similar in both structure and behaviour, with
    the
    exception of the cheetah, which significantly stands out from the other big and small cats. All cats a carnivores
    and
    some are efficient apex predators.[3] Their native ranges include the Americas, Africa, and Asia.</p>
